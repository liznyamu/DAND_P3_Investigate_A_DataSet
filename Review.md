# Review : Investigate A Dataset
## Meets Specifications

Dear Learner,

This was a brilliant submission and I enjoyed reviewing your work. By carefully going through the project, it shows a lot of effort, diligence and above all, understanding of the project. Excellent work! :clap: You have successfully passed all the rubrics of this project. All the efforts you put in to complete the project are very much appreciated and it was my pleasure reviewing this project. Remember, Perfect practice makes perfect. So keep practicing on these projects and I wish you all the best. :muscle:

I really love the way you tackled this project. Please keep up the spirit!:+1:
Can you take 2 minutes of your precious time and tell me what was the biggest challenge in accomplishing this project?. Also, I am always interested in improving my reviews so please let me know if this review was helpful. I get directly your feedback from the star ratings and comments about the review. Thanks in advance!:pray:

## Code Functionality

### All code is functional and produces no errors when run. The code given is sufficient to reproduce the results described.
:white_check_mark: Well done! The submitted code works well as it doesn't produce errors when run.

### The project uses NumPy arrays and Pandas Series and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Where possible, vectorized operations and built-in functions are used instead of loops.

Excellent work using Pandas library to facilitate the work for this submission.

### Learning Notes
Some important Pandas built-in functions:
- [Value-Counts](https://chrisalbon.com/python/pandas_dataframe_count_values.html)
- [Boolean-Indexing](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#boolean-indexing)
- [Group-by](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html)


### The code makes use of functions to avoid repetitive code. The code contains good comments and variable names, making it easy to read.
:white_check_mark: Good work using descriptive names and comments in your code which makes it easier for other programmers to follow-up on the work.

Learning Notes
- [Why use functions in programming?](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/functions.html)
- See [this material](http://zetcode.com/lang/python/functions/) for the importance of using functions in python.
- [Why should we comment code?](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/commenting.html)
- See also [google comments guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Comments) on how and where to put comments.
- See [google naming guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Naming#Naming) for a guide on variable names.


## Quality of Analysis
### The project clearly states one or more questions, then addresses those questions in the rest of the analysis.
:white_check_mark: Nice job stating questions and addressing the questions throughout the analysis.

## Data Wrangling Phase
### The project documents any changes that were made to clean the data, such as merging multiple files, handling missing values, etc.
:white_check_mark: The data wrangling phase is well documented.:+1:

### Tips
I read [this blog](http://www.datawatch.com/what-is-data-wrangling/) on data wrangling and found it very educative reason why 

I suggest you read that as well.
[How to handle missing values in a dataset.](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Methods-for-handling-missing-values-1)

## Exploration Phase
### The project investigates the stated question(s) from multiple angles. At least three variables are investigated using both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.
:white_check_mark: Nice job investigating the stated questions from multiple angles.

#### Learning Notes
- [This link](http://www.math.kent.edu/~reed/Instructors/MATH%2010041/Ch4/Univariate%20vs%20bivariate%20data.pdf) contains good material on Differences between Univariate and Bivariate data as shown below.

![Summary : Differences between univariate and bivariate data](https://github.com/liznyamu/DAND_P3_Investigate_A_DataSet/blob/master/UnivariateVsBiVariate.png)

### The project's visualizations are varied and show multiple comparisons and trends. Relevant statistics are computed throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data.

### At least two kinds of plots should be created as part of the explorations.
:white_check_mark: Visualizing data requires a lot of patience and determination because it's not easy selecting the best visualization to match with a given data type. Well enough, the project rightly builds descriptive visualizations using a variety of plots.:+1:

## Conclusions Phase
### The results of the analysis are presented such that any limitations are clear. The analysis does not state or imply that one change causes another based solely on a correlation.
:white_check_mark: Good work presenting the results of the analysis.

#### Learning Notes
- A description of limitations typically identifies either a shortcoming of the dataset that has caused difficulty (e.g. missing data) or a shortcoming of the methods of analysis (e.g. a statistical approach which may not be ideal given the characteristics of the data set).

## Communication

### Reasoning is provided for each analysis decision, plot, and statistical summary.
:white_check_mark: Great job!

### Visualizations made in the project depict the data in an appropriate manner that allows plots to be readily interpreted.
:white_check_mark: Good work!

#### Suggestions
- There are several other ways to visualize data including Box plots, Line graphs, Pie charts. Check out this [documentation](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/04.14-visualization-with-seaborn.html) on Visualization with Seaborn**.
