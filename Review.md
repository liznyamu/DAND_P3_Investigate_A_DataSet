I really love the way you tackled this project. Please keep up the spirit!:+1:
Can you take 2 minutes of your precious time and tell me what was the biggest challenge in accomplishing this project?. Also, I am always interested in improving my reviews so please let me know if this review was helpful. I get directly your feedback from the star ratings and comments about the review. Thanks in advance!:pray:

## Code Functionality

### All code is functional and produces no errors when run. The code given is sufficient to reproduce the results described.
:white_check_mark: Well done! The submitted code works well as it doesn't produce errors when run.

### The project uses NumPy arrays and Pandas Series and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Where possible, vectorized operations and built-in functions are used instead of loops.

Excellent work using Pandas library to facilitate the work for this submission.

### Learning Notes
Some important Pandas built-in functions:
- [Value-Counts](https://chrisalbon.com/python/pandas_dataframe_count_values.html)
- [Boolean-Indexing](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#boolean-indexing)
- [Group-by](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html)


### The code makes use of functions to avoid repetitive code. The code contains good comments and variable names, making it easy to read.
:white_check_mark: Good work using descriptive names and comments in your code which makes it easier for other programmers to follow-up on the work.

- See [this material](http://zetcode.com/lang/python/functions/) for the importance of using functions in python.
- [Why should we comment code?](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/commenting.html)
- See also [google comments guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Comments) on how and where to put comments.
- See [google naming guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Naming#Naming) for a guide on variable names.


## Quality of Analysis
### The project clearly states one or more questions, then addresses those questions in the rest of the analysis.
:white_check_mark: Nice job stating questions and addressing the questions throughout the analysis.

## Data Wrangling Phase
### The project documents any changes that were made to clean the data, such as merging multiple files, handling missing values, etc.
:white_check_mark: The data wrangling phase is well documented.:+1:

### Tips
I read [this blog](http://www.datawatch.com/what-is-data-wrangling/) on data wrangling and found it very educative reason why 

I suggest you read that as well.
[How to handle missing values in a dataset.](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Methods-for-handling-missing-values-1)

## Exploration Phase
### The project investigates the stated question(s) from multiple angles. At least three variables are investigated using both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.
:white_check_mark: Nice job investigating the stated questions from multiple angles.

### Learning Notes
- [This link](http://www.math.kent.edu/~reed/Instructors/MATH%2010041/Ch4/Univariate%20vs%20bivariate%20data.pdf) contains good material on Differences between Univariate and Bivariate data as shown below.
